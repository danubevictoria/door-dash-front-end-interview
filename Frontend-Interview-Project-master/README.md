To run:

1. Clone or fork this repo.
2. Make sure you have `node` installed, with a version greater than `7.0.0`. I highly recommend [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), or just installing the latest version of `node` with `brew install node` on macOS.
Once you have a good `node` installed, run `npm install` in this repo to get your dependencies.
3. Navigate to Frontend-Interview-Project-master folder by using ```cd``` and run
```npm start```. Below is example of what the folder path might look like.
```

```
5. Hit CTRL + C and run ```npm run api-server```.
6. Open a browser and navigate to the localhost port specified. Ex. ```http://localhost:61385/```
